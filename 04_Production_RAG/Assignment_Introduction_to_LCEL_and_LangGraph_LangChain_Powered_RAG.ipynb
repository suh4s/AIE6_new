            "content='As of my last update in October 2023, **LangGraph** refers to a framework or concept that integrates language processing with graph structures, often used in artificial intelligence and natural language processing contexts. This may involve representing linguistic data as graphs to facilitate better understanding, analysis, and generation of language through various models, especially in tasks such as document summarization, knowledge representation, and semantic understanding.\\n\\nThe specifics could vary depending on the context in which LangGraph is mentioned, such as a research paper, software library, or application. If there have been recent developments or specific applications of LangGraph beyond my last update, I would recommend checking the latest resources or research publications for the most accurate and detailed information.

        "# Understanding LangChain Runnables and LCEL\n",
        "\n",
        "In LangChain, a Runnable is like a LEGO brick in your AI application - it's a standardized component that can be easily connected with other components. The real power of Runnables comes from their ability to be combined in flexible ways using LCEL (LangChain Expression Language).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Features of Runnables\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Universal Interface\n",
        "Every Runnable in LangChain follows the same pattern:\n",
        "- Takes an input\n",
        "- Performs some operation\n",
        "- Returns an output\n",
        "\n",
        "This consistency means you can treat different components (like models, retrievers, or parsers) in the same way.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Built-in Parallelization\n",
        "Runnables come with methods for handling multiple inputs efficiently:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Process inputs in parallel, maintain order\n",
        "results = chain.batch([input1, input2, input3])\n",
        "\n",
        "# Process inputs as they complete\n",
        "for result in chain.batch_as_completed([input1, input2, input3]):\n",
        "    print(result)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Streaming Support\n",
        "Perfect for responsive applications:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Stream outputs as they're generated\n",
        "for chunk in chain.stream({\"query\": \"Tell me a story\"}):\n",
        "    print(chunk, end=\"\", flush=True)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Easy Composition\n",
        "The `|` operator makes building pipelines intuitive:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Create a basic RAG chain\n",
        "rag_chain = retriever | prompt | model | output_parser\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## Common Types of Runnables\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Language Models**: Like our `ChatOpenAI` instance\n",
        "- **Prompt Templates**: Format inputs consistently\n",
        "- **Retrievers**: Get relevant context from a vector store\n",

        "\n",
        "There are more options than what we'll see below - but this `AgentState` object is one that is stored in a `TypedDict` with the key `messages` and the value is a `Sequence` of `BaseMessages` that will be appended to whenever the state changes.\n",

        "    response: str\n",

        "\n",
        "Let's think about a simple example to help understand exactly what this means (we'll simplify a great deal to try and clearly communicate what state is doing):\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **We initialize our state object**:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   {\n",
        "       \"question\": \"\",\n",
        "       \"context\": [],\n",
        "       \"response\": \"\"\n",
        "   }\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Our user submits a query to our application.**  \n",
        "   We store the user's question in `state[\"question\"]`. Now we have:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   {\n",
        "       \"question\": \"How tall is the Eiffel Tower?\",\n",
        "       \"context\": [],\n",
        "       \"response\": \"\"\n",
        "   }\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **We pass our state object to an Agent node** which is able to read the current state. It will use the value of `state[\"question\"]` as input and might retrieve some context documents related to the question. It then generates a response which it stores in `state[\"response\"]`. For example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   {\n",
        "       \"question\": \"How tall is the Eiffel Tower?\",\n",

        "   }\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "That's it! The important part is that we have a consistent object (`State`) that's passed around, holding the crucial information as we go from one node to the next. This ensures our application has a single source of truth about what has happened so far and what is happening now.\n",

It provides several benefits, such as:\\n\\n1. **Async, Batch, and Streaming Support**: Any chain constructed using LCEL will have full synchronous, asynchronous, batch, and streaming capabilities. This allows for easy prototyping in environments like Jupyter notebooks and enables exposure of the chain as an asynchronous streaming interface.\\n\\n2. **Fallbacks**: LCEL facilitates the handling of errors gracefully through the use of fallbacks, which is particularly important due to the non-determinism of language models (LLMs).\\n\\n3. **Parallelism**: Since LLM applications may involve lengthy API calls, LCEL enables components that can be executed in parallel to be run automatically, enhancing efficiency.\\n\\nOverall, LCEL simplifies the process of writing and managing complex chains by leveraging these built-in features.'"
